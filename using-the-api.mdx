## Understanding the AI guessing flow

NLA is optimized for a chat/assistant style usage paradigm where you want to offload as much work to a large language model, as possible. For end users, the action setup flow that takes ~seconds (compared to minutes/hours with traditional, complex integration setup).

An action is then run (executed) via an API call with one single natural language parameter `instructions`. In the chat/assistant use case, these `instructions` are likely being generated by your own large language model. However NLA works just as well even in more traditional software paradigm where instructions are perhaps hard-coded into your codebase or supplied by the user directly.

Consider the case where you've built a chat product and your end user wants to expose a "Send Slack Message" action to your product. Their action setup [might look like this](https://cdn.zappy.app/d19215e5a2fb3896f6cddf435dfcbe27.png).

The user only has to pick Slack and authorize their Slack account. By default, all required fields are set to "Have AI guess". In this example there are two required fields: Channel and Message Text.

If a field uses "Have AI guess", two things happen:

1. When the action is run via the API, NLA will interpret passed `instructions` (using a language model) to fill in the values for Channel and Message Text. NLA is smart about fields like Channel -- Slack's API requires a Channel ID, not a plain text Channel name. NLA handles all such cases automatically.
2. The field will be listed as an optional hint parameter in the OpenAPI spec (see "hint parameters" below) which allows you (the developer) to override any `instructions` guessing.

Sometimes language models hallucinate or guess wrong. And if this were a particuarly sensitive Slack message, the user may not want to leave the selection of "Channel" up to chance. NLA allows the user [to use a specific, fixed value like this](https://cdn.zappy.app/dc4976635259b4889f8412d231fb3be4.png).

Now when the action executes, the Message Text will still be automatically guessed but Channel will be fixed to "#testing". This significantly increases user trust and unlocks use cases where the user may have partial but not full trust in an AI guessing.

We call the set of fields the user denoted "Have AI guess" as "hint parameters" -- Message Text above in the above example is one. They are _always_ optional. When running actions via the API, you (the developer) can choose to supply none/any/all hint parameters. Any hint parameters provided are treated exactly like "Use a specific value" at the user layer -- as an override.

One aside: custom fields. Zapier supports custom fields throughout the platform. The degenerate case is a spreadsheet, where every column is a custom field. This introduces complexity because sheet columns are unknowable at action setup time if the user picks "Have AI guess" for which spreadsheet. NLA handles such custom fields using the same pattern as above with one distinction: they are not listed as hint parameters because they are literally unknowable until run time. Also as you may expect, if the user picks a specific spreadsheet during action setup, custom fields act like regular fields and flow through normally.

In the typical chat/assistant product use case, you'll want to expose these hint parameters alongside the exposed action list to your own language model. Your language model is likely to have broader context about the user vs the narrowly constrained `instructions` string passed to the API and will result in a better guess.

In summary:

```bash
[user supplied "Use specific value"] --overrides--> [API call supplied hint parameters] --overrides--> [API call supplied "instructions"]
```

## Common API use cases

There are three common usages:

1. Get a list of the current user's exposed actions
2. Get a list of an action's optional hint parameters
3. Execute an action

Let's go through each, assuming you have a valid access token already.

## 1. Get a list of the current user's exposed actions

```bash
# via the RESTful list endpoint:
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/

# via the dynamic openapi.json schema:
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/openapi.json
```

Example of [full list endpoint response here](https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/), snipped below:

```bash
{
    "results": [
        {
            "id": "01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX",
            "description": "Slack: Send Channel Message",
            ...
```

Example of [full openapi.json response here](https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/openapi.json), snipped below:

```bash
{
    ...
    "paths": {
        ...
        "/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX/execute/": {
            "post": {
                "operationId": "exposed_01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX_execute",
                "summary": "Slack: Send Channel Message (execute)",
                ...
```

## 2. Get a list of an action's optional hint parameters

As a reminder, hint parameters are _always_ optional. By default, all parameters are filled in via guessing based on a provided `instructions` parameter. If a hint parameter is supplied in an API request along with instructions, the hint parameter will _override_ the guess.

```bash
# via the RESTful list endpoint:
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/

# via the dynamic openapi.json schema:
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/openapi.json
```

Example of [full list endpoint response here](https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/), snipped below:

```bash
{
    "results": [
        {
            "id": "01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX",
            "description": "Slack: Send Channel Message",
            "input_params": {
                "instructions": "str",
                "Message_Text": "str",
                "Channel": "str",
                ...
```

Example of [full openapi.json response here](https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/openapi.json), snipped below:

```bash
{
    ...
    "components": {
        "schemas": {
            ...
            "PreviewExecuteRequest_01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX": {
                "title": "PreviewExecuteRequest_01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX",
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "instructions": {
                        ...
                    },
                    "Message_Text": {
                        ...
                    },
                    "Channel_Name": {
                        ...
                    }
```

_Note: Every list of input_params will contain `instructions`, the only required parameter for execution._

## 3. Execute (or preview) an action

Finally, with an action ID and any desired, optional, hint parameters in hand, we can run (execute) an action. The parameter `instructions` is the only required parameter run an action.

```bash
curl -v \
    -d '{"instructions": "send a short poem about automation and robots to slack", "Channel_Name": "#fun-zapier"}' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST 'https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX/execute/'
```

Another example, this time an action to retrieve data:

```bash
curl -v \
    -d '{"instructions": "grab the latest email from bryan helmig"}' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST 'https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/01GTA3G1WD49GN1XXXXXXXXX/execute/'
```

One more example, this time requesting a preview of the action:

```bash
curl -v \
    -d '{"instructions": "say Hello World to #fun-zapier", "preview_only": true}' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST 'https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX/execute/'
```

## Execution Return data

### The Status Key

All actions will contain a `status`. The status can be one of four values:

`success`

The action executed successfully and found results.

`error`

The action failed to execute. An `error` key will have its value populated.

Example:

```bash
{
    ...
    "action_used": "Gmail: Send Email",
    "result": null,
    "status": "error",
    "error": "Error from app: Required field "subject" (subject) is missing. Required field "Body" (body) is missing."
}
```

`empty`

The action executed successfully, but no results were found. This status exists to be explicit that having an empty `result` is correct.

`preview`

The action is a preview and not a real execution. A `review_url` key will contain a URL to optionally execute the action from a browser, or just rerun without the `preview_only` input parameter.

Example:

```bash
{
    ...
    "action_used": "Slack: Send Channel Message",
    "input_params": {
        "Channel": "fun-zapier",
        "Message_Text": "Hello World"
    },
    "review_url": "https://nla.zapier.com/execution/01GW2E2ZNE5W07D32E41HFT5GJ/?needs_confirmation=true",
    "status": "preview",
}
```

### The Result Key

All actions will return trimmed `result` data. `result` is ideal for humans and language models alike! By default, `full_results` is not included but can be useful for machines (contact us if you'd like access to full results). The trimmed version is created using some AI and heuristics:

- selects for data that is plain text and human readable
- discards machine data like IDs, headers, etc.
- prioritizes data that is very popular on Zapier
- reduces final result into about ~500 words

Trimmed results are ideal for inserting directly back into the prompt context of a large language models without blowing up context token window limits.

Example of a trimmed results payload from "Gmail: Find Email":

```bash
{
    "result": {
        "from__email": "mike@zapier.com",
        "from__name": "Mike Knoop",
        "subject": "Re: Getting setup",
        "body_plain": "Hi Karla, thanks for following up. I can confirm I got access to everything! ... Thanks! Mike",
        "cc__emails": "bryan@zapier.com, wade@zapier.com"
        "to__email": "Mike Knoop",
    }
}
```
