## Overview
Zapier is an integration platform with over 5,000+ apps and 50,000+ actions. You can view the [full list here](https://zapier.com/apps). Zapier is used by millions of users, most of whom are non-technical builders -- but often savvy with software. Zapier offers several no code products to connect together the various apps on our platform. NLA exposes the same integrations Zapier uses to build our products, to you, to plug-in the capabilties of Zapier's platform into your own products.

For example, you can use the NLA API to:

  </Card>
  <Card title="... and thousands more, with one universal natural language API" icon="webhook">
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The typical use-case for NLA is to expose our ecosystem of thousands of apps/actions within your own product. NLA is optimized for products that receive user input in natural language (eg. chat, assistant, or other large language model based experience) -- that said, it can also be used to power any product that needs integrations. In this case, think of NLA as a more friendly, human API.

NLA contains a decade of experience with API shenanigans, so you don't have to. Common API complexity, automatically handled:
