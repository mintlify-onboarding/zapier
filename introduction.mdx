## Overview

Zapier is an integration platform with over 5,000+ apps and 50,000+ actions. You can view the [full list here](https://zapier.com/apps). Zapier is used by millions of users, most of whom are non-technical builders -- but often savvy with software. Zapier offers several no code products to connect together the various apps on our platform. NLA exposes the same integrations Zapier uses to build our products, to you, to plug-in the capabilties of Zapier's platform into your own products.

For example, you can use the NLA API to:

The typical use-case for NLA is to expose our ecosystem of thousands of apps/actions within your own product. NLA is optimized for products that receive user input in natural language (eg. chat, assistant, or other large language model based experience) -- that said, it can also be used to power any product that needs integrations. In this case, think of NLA as a more friendly, human API.

NLA contains a decade of experience with API shenanigans, so you don't have to. Common API complexity, automatically handled:

  <Card title="Every type of auth" icon="shield-halved">
    (Basic, Session, API Key, OAuth v1, Oauth v2, Digest,...), Zapier securely

  <Card title="Support for create, update, and search actions" icon="headset">
    endpoints optimized for natural language usage

  <Card title="Support for custom fields" icon="file-invoice">
    Spreadsheet, CRM, and Mailing List friendly!
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reference by name, not ID" icon="input-text">
    humans use natural language names, not IDs, to reference things in their
    apps, so NLA does too
  </Card>
  <Card title="Smart, human defaults" icon="brain">
    APIs sometimes have 100 options. Zapier's platform data helps us make NLA
    simpler for users out of the box
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Two Usage Modes

NLA handles all the underlying API auth and translation from natural language --> underlying API call --> return simplified output. The key idea is you (the developer), or your users, expose a set of actions via an oauth-like setup window, which you can then query and execute via a REST API. NLA offers both API Key and OAuth for signing NLA API requests.

<Card title="Server-side only (API Key)" icon="server">
  for quickly getting started, testing, and production scenarios where your app
  will only use actions exposed in the developer's Zapier account (and will use
  the developer's connected accounts on Zapier.com)
</Card>
<Card title="User-facing (Oauth)" icon="lock">
  for production scenarios where you are deploying an end-user facing
  application and your app needs access to end-user's exposed actions and
  connected accounts on Zapier.com
</Card>

### Why Natural Language?

Simply, it makes the API easier to use for both developers and users (and also for [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Large_language_models)!

We designed NLA to expose the power of Zapier's platform without passing along the complexity. A few design choices:

- There is a [user-facing component](https://cdn.zappy.app/83728f684b91c0afe7d435445fe4ac90.png) to NLA, exposed via a popup window, users set up and enable basic actions which "expose" them to you, the `provider`.
- The default action setup for users is minimal and fast. [All required fields are guessed](https://cdn.zappy.app/20afede9be56bf4e30d31986bc5325f8.png). This guessing is accomplished using an lanuage model on the NLA side.
- Users can [choose to override any guessed field](https://cdn.zappy.app/e07f6eabfe7512e9decf01cba0c9e847.png) with a fixed value or choice, increasing trust to use the natural language interface.
- Custom fields (ex. spreadsheet columns) can also be [dynamically guessed at action run time](https://cdn.zappy.app/9061499b4b973200fc345f695b33e3c7.png), or fixed by the user.

Using the API is then simple:

```bash
curl -v \
    -d '{"instructions": "Add Bryan Helmig at Zapier to my NLA test sheet, oh and he loves guitars!"}' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    'https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/<ACTION_ID>/execute/'
```

Or mix in some fixed values:

```bash
curl -v \
    -d '{"instructions": "Send a short poem about automation to slack", "channel": "#fun-zapier"}' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    'https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/<ACTION_ID>/execute/'
```
